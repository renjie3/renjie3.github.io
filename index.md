# About Me

<!-- Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~. -->
I am a fresh-year Ph.D. student of Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, advised by <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:normal">Professor Jiliang Tang</a> in <a href="http://dse.cse.msu.edu/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:normal">Data Science and Engineering Lab</a>. Before joining DSE, I was an algorithm engineer in Search Strategy Department, Baidu Inc. I got my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University where I spent my wonderful and unforgettable four years.
<br> <br>
My research interests include adversial attacks and defenses, the safety and robustness of deep learning. Now I am working on the robustness of self-supervised learning.
<br> <br>
My email address is renjie3 at msu.edu.
